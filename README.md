ViaCep ZipCode Finder, only Brazil.

ItÂ´s a easy way to find zip codes from Brazil.
Just open a index.html in your browser, put a brazilian zip code and find it.

Demo: https://jsfiddle.net/3L937o40/

I put all the code in just one file, 'index.html', if you want, you can break the code in other files.

Need a help, send a message. Have a nice day.
